## ## The problem

## Suppose that we have an SQL database that is used for a series of
## "reports" (e.g., graphs, knitr documents, data exports).  These
## reports might change because:
##
## * the data in the SQL database changes
## * we apply the reporting scripts to different subsets of the data
## * the code that we use to generate the scripts changes
##
## (among other more pathological reasons such as the packages that
## we're using changing behaviour, etc)
##
## We would like to be able to generate reports easily from the
## database and later on compare two reports and easily be able to
## determine _why_ two versions of a report differ - particularly with
## respect to the above criteria.  We'd also like to be able to get
## the original data that was used to create the reports (even if the
## SQL database has moved on) and the original scripts that were used
## to create the reports.

## ## Example

## As an example, we have a directory at `path` that contains
## orderly sources.  Typically this would be in the working directory
## (and in that case the `root` argument may be omitted) but for this
## vignette the path will be passed in explicitly.

## The `orderly.yml` to describe the creation of a report might look like:
##+ results = "asis", echo = FALSE
yaml_output(readLines(file.path(path_example, "orderly.yml")))

## Hopefully this is somewhat self explanatory:

## * `data` is the data sets to pull from the database; it is a named
##   list with one or more elements.  Each element is a list with a
##   `query` element containing a SQL query that specifies the
##   required data.  You can use placeholders like `?cyl` in the above
##   example to stand in for *parameters* that will be passed through
##   to the report.
##
## * `parameters` is a list of parameters used to query the SQL
##   database.  Note the that only the *names* of the parameters are
##   provided here - the values will be provided when the report is
##   run.
##
## * `script.R` is the R script that will be run to do the actual work
##   of the report - any R code can be used here.
##
## * `artefacts` is a list of "artefacts" that are created by the
##   `script`; these are *files* that contain the report itself.
##   There can be more than one artefact (there are two here).  Under
##   each filename, list the `format` (`"staticgraph"`,
##   `"interactivegraph"`, `"data"` for now) and a free-text
##   description.
##
## There are other optional fields that can be added to the yaml (and
## `parameters` is optional) but this is the core.  The file
## `script.R` for this report contains

##+ results = "asis", echo = FALSE
yaml_output(readLines(file.path(path_example, "script.R")))

## The important thing here is that the report references the variable
## `cars` and `cyl` even though it does not create them!  It must
## produce the files that are mentioned in `artefacts`
## (`disp_vs_wt.png` and `distribution.png`).  The R code can be as
## long and as short as needed and can use whatever packages it needs.
## `orderly` does not do anything with the script apart from run it so
## it can be formatted however (there are no magic comments, etc).
## There is no restrictions on what can be done except:
##
## * don't try to directly access the database
## * the script must create the artefacts listed in `orderly.yml`

## There is some more infrastructure that needs to be put in place
## around this; how does the report access the SQL database?  And
## where to the generated reports reside?
##+ results = "asis", echo = FALSE
plain_output(tree(path, "<root>"))

## The directories will be discussed in further detail below but we have:

## * `archive` - completed reports.  These are reports that we might
##   distribute to people or synchronise with a central point.
## * `data` - copies of the data used to create reports, stored so
##   that reports can be rerun later.
## * `draft` - draft reports.  Every run of a report will create a new
##   directory in here, but relatively few of these will be "final"
##   reports.  So reports exist here before being copied to `archive`.
## * `src` - the report *sources*; the files `orderly.yml` and
##   `script.R` are the files from above.
## * `orderly_config.yml` - this is the global configuration
## * `source.sqlite` - this is the example database used here

## The global configuration looks like:
##+ results = "asis", echo = FALSE
yaml_output(readLines(file.path(path, "orderly_config.yml")))

## This defines the field `database`, which describes the databases
## that we pull results from (the databases that the report queries
## are run against).  Each entry (here there is one called `source`)
## contains a field `driver` which must declare a DBI-compatible
## driver (realistically this is going to be `RSQLite::SQLite` for a
## local SQLite database and `RPostgres::Posgres` for accessing a
## postgres database), and then a block `args` which contains any
## arguments to be passed through to `DBI::dbConnect` along with the
## driver.  For SQLite this is just going to be `dbname` but for
## postgres this will include `host`, `port`, `user`, `dbname` and
## `password`.  For example:

## ```yaml
## database:
##   source:
##     driver: RSQLite::SQLite
##     args:
##       host: dbhost
##       port: 5432
##       user: myusername
##       password: s3cret
##       dbname: mydb
## ```

## In order to run anything (as below) the working directory must be
## somewhere above the root.  `orderly` will look in directories up
## towards the filesystem root for a file `orderly_config.yml` to
## determine the root.  For Rstudio users, creating an .Rproj file
## here is probably a good idea.

## ## Running a report

## Reports are run by *name*.  In the above configuration the report
## is called `example` because it is in the directory `src/example`.
## A list of report names can be returned by running
orderly::orderly_list(root = path)

## If the report requires parameters then these must be passed through
## too; in the above case the report takes the parameter `cyl` which
## must be passed through as a named list.  So we might run this
## report as
##+ collapse = TRUE
id <- orderly::orderly_run("example", list(cyl = 4), root = path)

### need this for later:
##+ echo = FALSE, results = "hide"
h <- sub("\\.rds$", "", dir(file.path(path, "data", "rds")))

## The return value is the id of the report (also printed on the
## second line of log output) and is always in the format
## `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-abcdef01` where the last 8 characters are a hex
## digits (i.e., 4 random bytes).  This means reports will
## automatically sort nicely but we'll have some collision resistance.
id

## Having run the report, the directory layout now looks like:
##+ results = "asis", echo = FALSE
plain_output(tree(path, "<root>"))

## Within `drafts`, the directory ``r file.path("example", id)`` has been
## created which contains the result of running the report.  In here
## there are the files:
##
## * `orderly.yml`: this is an exact copy of the input file
## * `script.R`: this is an exact copy of the script used for the analysis
## * `disp_vs_wt.png` and `distribution.png`: the artefacts created by
##    the report
## * `orderly_run.rds`: this is metadata about the run and includes
##   hashes of input files, of the data used, and of the output etc,
##   along with details about the packages used and the state of git.
##   It is stored in R's internal data format.

## Every time a report is run it will create a new directory at this
## level with a new id.  Running the report again now might create the
## directory ``r file.path("example", orderly:::new_report_id())``

## Note that there are other files created;
##
## * ``r file.path("data", "csv", paste0(h, ".csv"))``
## * ``r file.path("data", "rds", paste0(h, ".rds"))``
##
## These are a copy of the data as extracted from the database and
## used in the report.  The filenames are derived from a hash of the
## contents of the file, so if two reports use the same data then only
## one copy will be saved (this is quite likely if the upstream data
## and the query have not changed).  Two copies are saved - the rds
## version is faster to read and write, usually smaller, and is
## exactly the data as used, while the csv version is more easily read
## by other applications.

## We store the copies of files as run by orderly so that even if the
## input files change we can still easily get back to previous
## versions of the inputs, along side the outputs, and these are safe
## from any changes to the underlying source.

## You can see the list of draft reports like so:
orderly::orderly_list_drafts(root = path)

## Once you're happy with a report, then "commit" it with
##+ collapse = TRUE
orderly::orderly_commit(id, root = path)

## **THIS WILL CHANGE A LITTLE I THINK** - but mostly in how the index
## is built and how we might synchronise reports across people and
## machines.

## After this step our directory structure looks like:
##+ results = "asis", echo = FALSE
plain_output(tree(path, "<root>"))

## Which looks very like the previous, but files have been moved from
## being within `draft` to being within `archive`.  The other
## difference is that the index `orderly.sqlite` has been created.

## ## Developing a report

## First, create a directory within `src`.  The name is important and
## should not contain spaces (nor should it change as this will change
## the key report id and you'll lose a chain of history), then edit
## the file `orderly.yml` within that directory.
orderly::orderly_new("new", root = path)

## As a report becomes more complex, the function
## `orderly::orderly_test_start` will become useful; this function
## creates the isolated environment that orderly uses to run a report,
## but then leaves you to interactively work with your report.

## ## Customising the configuration

## The contents of `orderly_config.yml` may contain things like secrets
## (passwords) or hostnames that vary depending on deployment (e.g.,
## testing locally vs running on a remote system).  To customise this,
## you can use environment variables within the configuration.  So
## rather than writing

## ```yaml
## database:
##   source:
##     driver: RPostgres::Postgres
##     args:
##       host: localhost
##       port: 5432
##       user: myuser
##       dbname: databasename
##       password: p4ssw0rd
## ```

## you might write

## ```yaml
## database:
##   source:
##     driver: RPostgres::Postgres
##     args:
##       host: $MY_DBHOST
##       port: $MY_DBPORT
##       user: $MY_DBUSER
##       dbname: $MY_DBNAME
##       password: $MY_PASSWORD
## ```

## environment variables, as used this way **must** begin with a
## dollar sign and consist only of uppercase letters, numbers and the
## underscore character.  You can then set the environment variables
## in an `.Renviron` (either within the project or in your home
## directory) file or your `.profile` file.  Alternatively, you can
## create a file `orderly_envir.yml` in the same directory as
## `orderly_config.yml` with key-value pairs, such as

## ```yaml
## MY_DBHOST: localhost
## MY_DBPORT: 5432
## MY_DBUSER: myuser
## MY_DBNAME: databasename
## MY_PASSWORD: p4ssw0rd
## ```

## This will be read every time that `orderly_config.yml` is read (in
## contrast with .Renviron which is read only at the start of a
## session).  This will likely be more pleasant to work with.

## The advantage of using environment variables is that you can add
## the `orderly_envir.yml` file to your `.gitignore` and avoid
## committing system-dependent data to the central repository.

## To avoid leaving passwords in plain text, you can use `vault` to
## retrieve them.  To do this, set the value of the field to
## `VAULT:<path>:<field>`, where `<path>` is the name of a vault
## secret path (probably beginning with `/secret/` and `field` is the
## name of the field at that path.  So, for example:

## ```
## password: VAULT:/secret/users/database_user:password
## ```

## would look up the field `password` at the path
## `/secret/users/database_user`.  This can be stored in
## `orderly_config.yml`, in the contents of an environment variable or
## in `orderly_envir.yml`.
